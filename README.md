# Real-time-vehicle-detector
A modern Vehicle Detection Application built using Python (PyQt5 GUI) and YOLOv8 for real-time detection of cars and bikes from webcam or uploaded videos. Designed with a light, responsive, and elegant UI, this project provides a clean way to visualize object detection results directly inside a desktop interface.
